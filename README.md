Face Recognition Desktop App using Processing

This is a face recognition locking application developed for windows using Processing tool and language in Java mode. 

This is an experimental project as I tried to use the most basic algorithm for face recognition, i.e., Eigenfaces, in a different way. 

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
